Read media content from a file.

**Tips:**
- Make sure you follow the description of each tool parameter.
- A `<system>` tag will be given before the read file content.
- The system will notify you when there is anything wrong when reading the file.
- This tool is a tool that you typically want to use in parallel. Always read multiple files in one response when possible.
- This tool can only read image or video files. To read other types of files, use the ReadFile tool. To list directories, use the Glob tool or `ls` command via the Shell tool.
- If the file doesn't exist or path is invalid, an error will be returned.
- The maximum size that can be read is 100MB. An error will be returned if the file is larger than this limit.
- The media content will be returned in a form that you can directly view and understand.

**Capabilities**
- This tool supports image and video files for the current model.
